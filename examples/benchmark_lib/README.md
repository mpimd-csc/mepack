benchmark_lib
=============

This directory contains a set of routines supporting the benchmarks. They are
not required to use MEPACK in your own projects.

The [`slicot`](./slicot/README.md) directory contains some routines from the
SLICOT library, which are used for comparison in some benchmarks.
