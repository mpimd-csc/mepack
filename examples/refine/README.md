Refinement Examples
===================

This directory contains examples and tests for the iterative refinement
routines, i.e. solving equations with general coefficient matrices and uses
iterative refinement to achieve a better accuracy. The examples are used as
tests codes as well.  All examples feature the `--help` command line options to
view the actual parameters that can be used to adjust the example,

The following iterative refinemet example and test codes are available:
- `refine_gelyap`:  Solve the standard Lyapunov equation (LYAP) in double
					precision.
